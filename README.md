### Hi, I'm Chris ðŸ‘‹

I am a Fullstack developer who loves to build out projects and bring new ideas to life. Originally, I pursued Data Science / Data Analysis because I enjoy playing with numbers, but I realized that building out cool products was my true goal. 

I do my most of my work in the NERD or MERN stack and am actively learning Typescript.
